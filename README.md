# Passtracing

**Drawing/tracing projector in Augmented Reality (Passthrough)**

This is a simple [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev) app built with [three.js](https://threejs.org) and [three-mesh-ui](https://felixmariotto.github.io/three-mesh-ui/) that lets you use your Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro to draw/trace on top of virtual images in Augmented Reality.

Inspired by [Easely](https://github.com/RalphVR/easely-meta-hackathon) and [Contour](https://sidequestvr.com/app/6643/contour-demo).
